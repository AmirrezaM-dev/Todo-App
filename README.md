[Live Demo](https://todo.tdem.ir) - The first visit might take 1 minute of loading, please be patient.

Made with React.js, Node.js (Express.js), MongoDB

Features:

+ One-time loading (This app is so fast even if you have a slow internet connection, with the system that I developed it will still work as fast as possible)
+ Sing Up
+ Sign In
+ Add a task related to the selected date
+ Add a child task related to the selected task
+ Change statuses or Modify or Delete tasks
+ Mark tasks as important (Important tasks appear on every date)

Side effects of the one-time loading system :
Extra code, if the client has a really slow connection they are still allowed to use the website and make too many changes as fast as they would like to, but as a result many bugs might happen which I fixed all with extra code (the extra code is normal javascript code which won't make the app slow, after all this app supposed to be faster than a normal app and I would not write a code that makes this app slower)
